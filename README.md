#### Developer Info

#### App Background
This App is created as personal portfolio App, to practice with the new Apple framework **SwiftUI** and the implementation of Google AdMob SDK.

Next to that I experimented with Apples own **SF symbols, ColorPicker, Shake Gesture, @Environment, @Published, @AppStorage and Observable objects**
to mention a couple key components I wanted to experiment with within **SwiftUI**.

This is the first "Game" app i created, so better to start simple :).


If you got any suggestions for new features or found any bugs in the app please don't hesitate to contact me at <exandos@outlook.com>.




## I hope you enjoy the App!



Greetings,

**Giordano Menegazzi**
